✅ 3. Implement flashcard-style review interface
✅ 4. Track review progress and remove mastered words
✅ 5. Add spaced repetition logic (show harder words more often)
✅ 6. Use existing dark theme

========================================
FILES CREATED:
========================================

1. src/app/review/page.tsx (478 lines)
   - Main review mode component
   - Flashcard interface
   - Spaced repetition algorithm
   - Keyboard shortcuts support
   - Progress tracking
   - Empty/loading/completion states

2. REVIEW_MODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md (238 lines)
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Technical details
   - Testing recommendations
   - Future enhancements

========================================
FILES MODIFIED:
========================================

1. src/components/Navigation.tsx

========================================
KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
========================================

1. REVIEW FLOW:
   - Show word (flashcard front)
   - User clicks "뜻 보기" to reveal meaning
   - User chooses:
     * "알았어요" → Removes from review, marks mastered
     * "모르겠어요" → Keeps in rotation, increases priority

2. SPACED REPETITION:
   - Wrong words: Priority = WrongCount × 2 (max 10)
   - Postponed words: Priority = 1
   - Weighted shuffle ensures difficult words appear more often
   - Higher priority = more frequent appearance

3. WORD REMOVAL LOGIC:
   - "알았어요" (Know it):
     * Wrong words → Mastered = true in DB
     * Postponed words → Remove from postponed_days
     * Immediate removal from session
   
   - "모르겠어요" (Don't know):
     * Priority +1
     * Move to end of queue
     * Reappears later in session

4. UI/UX FEATURES:
   - Real-time progress bar
   - Source badges (오답 노트 / 미룬 단어)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (1/Y, 2/N)
   - Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
   - Smooth animations
   - Dark theme consistency
   - Completion screen with stats

5. EDGE CASES HANDLED:
   - No words to review (empty state)
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Authentication redirect
   - Single word review
   - Completion flow

========================================
API ENDPOINTS USED:
========================================

GET /api/wrong?email={email}        - Fetch wrong words
POST /api/wrong                      - Mark word as mastered
GET /api/postpone?email={email}      - Fetch postponed days
DELETE /api/postpone                 - Remove completed postponed day
GET /api/words                       - Fetch all words

========================================
